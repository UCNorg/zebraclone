                Rodney and Denise Steidinger, both raised on hardworking Illinois farms, brought their deep-rooted work ethic and passion for growth to sunny Arizona in 2006. Married in 2000, they shared a love for cultivating the land and a dedication to excellence.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                When Rodney began working in landscaping after their move, Denise supported him by managing the business's bookkeeping and marketing, allowing them to combine their strengths for success. However, in 2008, the economic downturn left Rodney without a job, pushing the couple to make a bold decision: to create their own business.

                In 2009, Rodney and Denise founded TKHaley Yard Care, a landscaping business inspired by their three daughters: Trinity, Kiley, and Haley. Their work soon became known throughout the Prescott community for its quality and commitment, and as they grew, so did their desire to give back.

                In 2013, they took a step closer to their mission of supporting children by becoming licensed foster parents, welcoming Ella into their home and officially adopting her in 2014. These experiences strengthened their sense of purpose and commitment to the community.

                In 2015, Rodney and Denise took a leap and rebranded their business to ZebraScapes, LLC, symbolizing their desire to create an unforgettable brand. Their trucks, wrapped in distinctive zebra stripes, became a recognizable symbol of quality service, and they even acquired live zebras on their Williamson Valley Road property.

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                ZebraScapes quickly became known for its unique identity and commitment to designing, building, and maintaining fully functional outdoor spaces that exceed client expectations.
